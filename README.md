## Description
![Hive screenshots](/img/screens.jpg?raw=true "Hive screenshots")

Hive is the perfect way for people nearby to cooperate and help each other instantly. If you have something to share with others right away, Hive allows you to create offers with your current location tracking, so that your offers are displayed on map exactly where you are in real-time. You can offer anything from food and drinks to taxi rides. Everyone looking for immediate goods and services, can easily search for offers provided by Hive users that are already close to them, instead of shopping and waiting for delivery.

Have you ever had something with you, that you don't really need right now? A book? A chocolate? A snack? A bottle of water? Flowers? Umbrella? Old hat? Instead of throwing it to trash, offer it to people nearby. How? Join Hive! Whether it is things or services, offer something, that you don't need instantly, to others. It is like sharing a taxi ride, but for anything. Don't be shy! You definitely have something to offer to the world!

Ever found yourself in the street craving for a sip of water and no shop around? And there are all those people with bottles in their hands or attached to their backpacks without even noticing it? How to know, if they are willing to share? Join Hive and see if there is someone nearby offering exactly what you are looking for.

There are more than 7 billion people on our planet. Start sharing things and help each other. Let's make the world a more friendly place together!

OFFER ANYTHING TO ANYONE

FIND OFFERS CLOSE TO YOU

Find what you need exactly where you need it. See offers displayed on map at their location updated in real-time or arranged in a list. Filter and sort your search results by different criteria.

SEND MESSAGES

Contact other users by sending messages directly in the app. Browse old messages history in chat archive.

DETAILED CONTACTS

Publish detailed information about your contacts in profile, so that other users can reach you outside the app as soon as possible.

Save your favorite users and offers for future reference.

REVIEWS AND COMMENTS

Leave reviews on offers provided by other users. Comment on reviews left on your own offers. Build user trust by providing best offers with high average rating.

BADGES FOR ACHIEVEMENTS

UP AND RUNNING QUICKLY

Just register with your email, Google or Facebook account and you are ready to go. You can fill all your profile info later.

NO ADS

Only offers provided by people like you.

Please note that if you have active (visible) offers, Hive constantly tracks your location, which can decrease battery life.
